## news

2024.3.25 I have already release the Ground-fusion codes (Ubuntu 20.04 version).

2024.1.29 Accepted by ICRA2024. I have already released the datasets, and will release the code soon.

   

## Introduction

We introduce Ground-Fusion, a low-cost sensor fusion simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system for ground vehicles. Our system features efficient initialization, effective sensor anomaly detection and handling, real-time dense color mapping, and robust localization in diverse environments. We tightly integrate RGB-D images, inertial measurements, wheel odometer and GNSS signals within a factor graph to achieve accurate and reliable localization both indoors and outdoors. To ensure successful initialization, we propose an efficient strategy that comprises three different methods: stationary, visual, and dynamic, tailored to handle diverse cases. Furthermore, we develop mechanisms to detect sensor anomalies and degradation, handling them adeptly to maintain system accuracy. 

The preprint version of paper is [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14308).
The dataset is at [https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR-plus](https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR-plus) and [https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR](https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR).

## 1. Prerequisites and Installation
### 1.1 Ubuntu and ROS
Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 (with ROS Melodic and OpenCV3) and on Ubuntu 20.04(with ROS Noetic and OpenCV4).

### 1.2 OpenCV
This package requires [OpenCV 3/4](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and some features of C++11. 

### 1.3 Eigen, Ceres, and PCL
This package requires [Eigen 3.3.7](), [Ceres 1.14](https://ceres-solver.googlesource.com/ceres-solver),[Sophus](https://github.com/strasdat/Sophus.git ) and [PCL 1.11](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl).
You need to download they in your thirdparty folder, and then:
~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y cmake libgoogle-glog-dev libgflags-dev libatlas-base-dev libsuitesparse-dev 
cd thirdparty/eigen
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
cd ../../ceres-solver
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc) 
sudo make install
sudo apt-get install -y libflann-dev libvtk6-dev libboost-all-dev ros-noetic-pcl-ros libfmt-dev
cd ../../pcl
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
cd ../../Sophus
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc) 
sudo make install
~~~


### 1.4 Gnss_comm
This package also requires [gnss_comm](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/gnss_comm) for ROS message definitions and some utility functions.

### 1.5 Configure gcc (For Ubuntu 20.04)
~~~
sudo apt-get install g++-8
sudo apt-get install gcc-8
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 20
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8 20
~~~

### 1.6 Build Ground-Fusion
After install all 3rd partiesï¼š
~~~
mkdir -p ~/Groundfusion_ws/src
cd ~/Groundfusion_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/gnss_comm
git clone -b ubuntu18_version https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/Ground-Fusion
cd ../..
catkin_make -j12
