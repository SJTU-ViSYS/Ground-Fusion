## News 
- **üî•`2025/06/16`**: Introducing our new paper on IROS2025:"Towards Robust Sensor-Fusion Ground SLAM: A Comprehensive Benchmark and A Resilient Framework" is accepted to IROS2025!code: **[Ground-Fusion++](https://github.com/sjtuyinjie/Ground-Fusion2)**, dataset: **[M3DGR](https://github.com/sjtuyinjie/M3DGR)**! 


## NOTICE
### We warmly welcome and highly recommend the integration of the Ground-Fusion system into your projects for several compelling reasons:

1. **üî•Comprehensive Sensor Suite**: The Ground-Fusion system is equipped with a multitude of sensors (RGBD-IMU-Wheel-GNSS), facilitating an easy onset for enhancements to any module. This richness in sensory input streamlines the process of adapting and refining components within the system.

2. **‚≠êÔ∏èOpen-Source Ecosystem**: Both the Ground-Fusion algorithm and associated datasets such as [**M2DGR-plus**](https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR-plus) and the [**Ground-Challenge**](https://github.com/sjtuyinjie/Ground-Challenge) are openly available, forming a comprehensive bechmark suite. **Welcome to beat Ground-Fusion on M2DGR and Ground-Challenge!**

3. **üöÄProven Performance**: The Ground-Fusion algorithm has been rigorously validated across diverse datasets, establishing itself as SOTA in lidar-less SLAM algorithms. Outperforming Ground-Fusion on these benchmarks would significantly bolster the credibility of your proposed method.




## Introduction



We introduce Ground-Fusion, a low-cost sensor fusion simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system for ground vehicles. Our system features efficient initialization, effective sensor anomaly detection and handling, real-time dense color mapping, and robust localization in diverse environments. We tightly integrate RGB-D images, inertial measurements, wheel odometer and GNSS signals within a factor graph to achieve accurate and reliable localization both indoors and outdoors. To ensure successful initialization, we propose an efficient strategy that comprises three different methods: stationary, visual, and dynamic, tailored to handle diverse cases. Furthermore, we develop mechanisms to detect sensor anomalies and degradation, handling them adeptly to maintain system accuracy. 

The preprint version of paper is [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14308).
The dataset is at [**M2DGR-plus**](https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR-plus), [**Ground-Challenge**](https://github.com/sjtuyinjie/Ground-Challenge) and [**M2DGR**](https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR).

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Prerequisites & Installation

### 1.1 OS & ROS Support  
‚úÖ Ubuntu 18.04 + ROS Melodic + OpenCV3  
‚úÖ Ubuntu 20.04 + ROS Noetic + OpenCV4


### 1.2 OpenCV
This package requires [OpenCV 3/4](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and some features of C++11. 

### 1.3 Eigen, Ceres, and PCL
This package requires [Eigen 3.3.7](https://github.com/PX4/eigen), [Ceres 1.14](https://ceres-solver.googlesource.com/ceres-solver),[Sophus](https://github.com/strasdat/Sophus.git ) and [PCL 1.10 or 1.11](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl).
You need to download they in your thirdparty folder, and then:
~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y cmake libgoogle-glog-dev libgflags-dev libatlas-base-dev libsuitesparse-dev 
cd thirdparty/eigen
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
cd ../../ceres-solver
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc) 
sudo make install
sudo apt-get install -y libflann-dev libvtk6-dev libboost-all-dev ros-noetic-pcl-ros (for ubuntu20.04) libfmt-dev
cd ../../pcl
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
cd ../../Sophus
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc) 
sudo make install
~~~


### 1.4 Gnss_comm
This package also requires [gnss_comm](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/gnss_comm) for ROS message definitions and some utility functions.

### 1.5 Configure gcc (For Ubuntu 20.04)
~~~
sudo apt-get install g++-8
sudo apt-get install gcc-8
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 20
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8 20
~~~

### 1.6 Build Ground-Fusion
After install all 3rd partiesÔºö
~~~
mkdir -p ~/Groundfusion_ws/src
cd ~/Groundfusion_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/gnss_comm
git clone https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/Ground-Fusion
cd ../..
catkin_make -j12
~~~

> üí° Tip: If you encounter `Sophus` issues, try building both template and non-template versions.





## üöÄ 2. Run Examples


### 2.1 Ground-challenge dataset
Download [Ground-challenge](https://github.com/sjtuyinjie/Ground-Challenge) dataset and give a star.

~~~
# [launch] open a terminal and type:
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch vins groundfusion.launch

# [run localization] open another terminal:
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun vins vins_node src/Ground-Fusion/config/realsense/groundchallenge.yaml

# [dense map]open third terminal:
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun dense_map dense_map_node src/Ground-Fusion/config/realsense/groundchallenge.yaml

# [play rosbag]open forth terminal:
rosbag play office3.bag
~~~

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Mapping node is resource-intensive, affecting the real-time performance of the entire system. So it's suggested that do not run this node unless necessary. We are working on optimizing the mapping node currently




### 2.2 M2DGR-Plus dataset
Download [M2DGR-Plus](https://github.com/sjtuyinjie/M2DGR-plus) dataset and give a star.


~~~
# [launch] open a terminal and type:
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch vins groundfusion.launch

# [run localization] open another terminal:
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun vins vins_node src/Ground-Fusion/config/realsense/m2dgrp.yaml

# [dense map]open third terminal:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues**:  
> - Ground-Fusion may perform better *without GNSS* on M2DGR-Plus due to its low (1Hz) GNSS frequency.  
> - Initialization thresholds may need tuning to avoid early-phase drift.  
> - A more advanced version of Ground-Fusion is under development ‚Äî stay tuned!
